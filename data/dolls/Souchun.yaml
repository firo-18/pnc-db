            After Souchun deals 3 Normal Attacks, boosts her Max HP by (100%) of her Hashrate and recovers an equivalent amount of HP.
            This effect can be triggered up to 10 times. Every 30 points of extra HP gained enhances Souchun's Operand DEF by 1 point.

            Souchun then heals herself by 0.5% of her Max HP per bound enemies.
